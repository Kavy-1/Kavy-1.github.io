        <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Over the past four years of high school, I narrowed down the intense decision of what career I wanted to 
           pursue. I concluded that I wanted to be in an evolving career as a computer programmer. As I searched among 
           universities, privite colleges, and other "bootcamps" for computer programming, I decided Prime Digital Academy
           was the best fit for me.</p>
      
          <p>I perform well when working with a team and succeed just as well working individually. I'm a determined, task
           oriented, hard working individual who pushes the boundaries and finds answers to problems. I enjoy learning new
           concepts that will expand my skill set as a person and ensure that I am set up for success in this thriving career.
           I'm motivated and would be an excellent fit at Prime Digital Academy.</p>
